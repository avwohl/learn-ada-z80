## Highlights

### Calculator
Demonstrates enumerations, case statements, exceptions, and formatted output.

### Sorting Algorithms
Shows array manipulation, procedures with in/out parameters, and algorithm comparison.

### Bit Operations
Essential for Z80 hardware programming - bit set/clear/toggle, rotation, masking.

### Temperature Converter
Uses derived types for type safety - can't accidentally mix Celsius and Fahrenheit!
